# Bitcoin Point of Sale Page

This is the source code for http://pos.bitcoincoop.org/

This is a simple Point-of-Sale page that merchants can run on a tablet or phone to convert dollars to bitcoins and receive payments from customers.  

A setup page allows anyone to configure some basic parameters like title, logo, address, exchange, and commission: http://pos.bitcoincoop.org/setup

These parameters can be saved and made available at a convenient URL.

# Technical Details

The site is programmed in HTML and Coffeescript using NodeJS and jQuery. Account details and transactions are stored in a Redis database.

We use the websocket payment notification API from http://blockchain.info/api/api_websocket to listen for and display payment notifications in real time. The bitcoin exchange rates are fetched from http://bitcoincharts.com/ and cached with a 15 minute expiry.

When transactions are detected, they're logged along with the current exchange rate. A report is provided so that merchants can account for how many bitcoins they received in a given time period and see their equivalent dollar value. This allows us to insulate merchants from bitcoin market volatility by offering to purchase their bitcoins for exactly what they were worth at the time of sale.

# Installation

Install nodeJS (http://nodejs.org/) and redis (http://redis.io/) then:

    git clone https://github.com/asoltys/pos.bitcoincoop.org pos
    cd pos
    npm install  
    coffee app

Now the app should be runnning at http://localhost:3000/
