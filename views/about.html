          <h1>What are bitcoins?</h1>
          Bitcoins are units of digital currency that can be 
          transferred over the Internet. They get stored at a 
          unique address which is like an online wallet or 
          bank account that you can access with a 
          password. Registering a new address is free and 
          is as easy as signing up for an email account. 
          Transactions between bitcoin addresses are 
          recorded in a public record that's published on 
          the Internet and keeps track of what amounts are 
          stored at every address. Fifty new bitcoins are 
          generated by a mathematical algorithm every ten 
          minutes and are distributed to people who 
          contribute computing power to the network. The 
          software to participate in the network is free so 
          anyone can run it. Over time, fewer and fewer 
          bitcoins will be created until there are a total of 
          21 million of them by the year 2040. Each bitcoin 
          is divisible up to 8 decimal places, making 
          it possible to transact tiny amounts.

          <h1>Why use them?</h1>
          They're free, fast, secure, and global.  Merchants 
          don't get charged for accepting them and you don't 
          get charged for transferring them, even 
          internationally. There are no fees, prerequisites, or 
          limits. You can register addresses anonymously and 
          create as many accounts as you like. They can 
          never be frozen because no central authority 
          controls them. Whether you're sending a fraction of 
          a cent or a million dollars, the network doesn't 
          discriminate. You can use bitcoins to securely store 
          and backup your savings and gain access to them 
          from anywhere that has Internet. Bitcoins tend to 
          appreciate in value over time because of their 
          limited supply so they make a good investment. 
          Unlike dollars and other national currencies, no 
          government or issuing authority can print more of 
          them.

          <h1>What can I buy with them?</h1>
          The number of companies accepting bitcoins is 
          growing quickly but their immediate utility still isn't 
          so much as a VISA/Mastercard/Debit competitor for 
          retail commerce but as an alternative to Western 
          Union, PayPal and the Big Banks as a means of 
          transferring value. They enable you to send free, 
          immediate payments to your friends and family 
          from a phone or laptop so you can pay a co-worker 
          back for coffee, transfer wages to family overseas, 
          or donate to organizations like WikiLeaks who have 
          been cut off by the major payment companies. 
          We're working to get more stores accepting them in 
          Vancouver though because we believe it'll be in 
          their best interest to avoid the transaction fees 
          charged by the credit card companies. Transaction 
          fees end up getting built into the prices we pay for 
          goods and services across the board so we're all 
          subsidizing the big banks and credit card 
          companies indirectly whether we use their services 
          or not.

        <div class="span6">
          <h1>How is their price set?</h1>
          Most merchants accepting bitcoin will use an 
          exchange rate from  one of the online markets 
          like cavirtex.com to determine their equivalent 
          dollar value. The exchange rate is simply the last 
          price that some seller was able to charge some 
          buyer for bitcoins in the free market and is 
          governed by supply and demand.
          Bitcoins aren't backed by any underlying 
          commodity or insured by any authority. They 
          have an intrinsic value however as a superior 
          form of currency due to their mathematically 
          guaranteed scarcity, security, ease of use, 
          distributed nature, lack of fees, divisibility, and 
          global recognition.
          At vanbtc.ca we offer to pay cash to local 
          merchants in exchange for bitcoins they receive 
          as payment. We also offer to sell bitcoins for cash 
          in person at various locations. We peg our rates 
          to cavirtex.com and don't take any commission.
