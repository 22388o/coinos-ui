          <h1>What are bitcoins?</h1>
          <p>
          Bitcoins are units of digital currency that can be 
          transferred over the Internet.
          They get sent to a bitcoin address and stored in a digital wallet 
          that you can access with a 
          password. Creating and using a new wallet and address is free and as
          easy as email -- <a href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/new">try it</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Transactions between bitcoin addresses are 
          recorded in a public file and <a href="http://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions">published on 
          the Internet</a>.  This file, or "block chain", keeps track of what amounts are 
          stored at what addresses.
          </p>
          
          About every 10 minutes, 50 new bitcoins are 
          generated by a mathematical algorithm and distributed to people who 
          contribute computing power to the network. The 
          <a href="http://bitcoin.org">software to participate in the network</a> is free and open source so anyone can run it on their computer.
          </p>

          <p>
          Over time, fewer and fewer 
          bitcoins will be created until there are a total of 
          21 million of them in circulation by the year 2040. Each bitcoin 
          is divisible up to 8 decimal places, making 
          it possible to transact very small portions of them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h1>Why use them?</h1>
          <p>
          They're free, fast, secure, and global.  Merchants 
          don't get charged for accepting them and you don't 
          get charged for transferring them, even 
          internationally. There are no fees, prerequisites, or 
          limits. You can register addresses anonymously and 
          create as many accounts as you like. They can 
          never be frozen because no central authority 
          controls them. Whether you're sending a fraction of 
          a cent or a million dollars, the network doesn't 
          discriminate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          You can use bitcoins to securely store 
          and backup your savings and gain access to them 
          from anywhere that has Internet access. They tend to 
          appreciate in value over time because of their 
          limited supply so they make a good investment. 
          Unlike dollars and other national currencies, no 
          government or issuing authority can print more of 
          them.
          </p>

          <p>
          Bitcoins enable you to send free, 
          immediate payments to your friends and family 
          from your phone or laptop so you can pay a co-worker 
          back for coffee, transfer wages to family overseas, 
          or donate to organizations like WikiLeaks who have 
          been cut off by the major payment companies.

          There are also several bitcoin markets operating online. The largest one in Canada 
          is <a href="http://cavirtex.com/">cavirtex.com</a> and is run out of Calgary. They link up buyers and sellers and facilitate trades by 
          allowing you to deposit and withdraw Canadian dollars directly from your bank account. A list of other 
          online exchanges and their rates can be found at <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com">bitcoincharts.com</a>.

          <h1>How is their price set?</h1>
          <p>
          Most merchants accepting bitcoin will use an 
          exchange rate from  one of the online markets 
          to determine their equivalent 
          dollar value. The exchange rate is simply the last 
          price that some seller was able to charge some 
          buyer for bitcoins in the free market and is 
          governed by supply and demand.
          </p>

          <p>
          Bitcoins aren't backed by any underlying 
          commodity or insured by any authority. They 
          have value as a form of currency due to their mathematically 
          guaranteed scarcity, security, ease of use, 
          distributed nature, lack of fees, divisibility, and 
          global recognition.

          The number of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade">companies accepting bitcoins</a>
          is growing quickly. We're working to get more stores accepting them in 
          Vancouver.  We believe it'll be in 
          their best interest to avoid the transaction fees 
          charged by the credit card companies. Transaction 
          fees end up getting built into the prices we pay for 
          goods and services across the board so we're 
          indirectly subsidizing the big banks and credit card 
          companies whether we personally use their services 
          or not.
