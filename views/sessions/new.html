        <h2>Notice to Merchants</h2>
        <p>On May 3, 2014, our hosting provider experienced a technical glitch that caused our server to be wiped out along with our database and backups.  Unfortunately this means that all CoinOS accounts will need to be recreated.  We're taking measures to ensure that we have off-site backups and redundant hosting in place so that this won't happen again.  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@bitcoincoop.org">info@bitcoincoop.org</a> and we'll provide a fuller explanation and help you get up and running again.  Our volunteer representatives will also be going out to visit some of you in the coming days. 
        </p>
        <p> We're so sorry for the inconvenience and want to take this opportunity to let you know that we appreciate you using our system and working with us.  We've got lots of improvements in the works that we're excited to share with you soon.
      </p>
      <p>
      Regards,<br />
