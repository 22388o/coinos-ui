If you're a resident of Vancouver and would like to be listed as a local exchanger here, come to our monthly meetup group and introduce yourself! We'll teach you everything you need to know and if you agree to use our posted rates and we get the sense that you'll be fair and professional then we'll happily list you on our <a href="/exchangers">exchangers page</a>.

<h2>Our Rates</h2>

<p>
The exchange rates on this website are pegged to the current market prices at <a href="http://cavirtex.com/">cavirtex.com</a> and are updated every 15 minutes.  Specifically, we take an average of the bid/ask prices in the order books there using a market depth of $1000 CAD.
