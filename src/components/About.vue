          Coinos is a bitcoin wallet app developed by
          <a href="https://adamsoltys.com/">Adam Soltys</a>. You can
          <a href="https://github.com/asoltys/coinos.io"
            >install and host it yourself</a
          >
          on your own server and connect it to your bitcoin and lightning nodes
          if you want full control of your funds. Or, simply create an account here at 
          <a href="https://coinos.io">coinos.io</a>, a free, public server that you can
          begin using right away without providing any personal information.

          My aim with this app is to provide a user-friendly interface to send and
          receive bitcoin payments for both individuals wanting a day-to-day
          spending wallet and merchants seeking to receive payments in an
          in-person retail setting. Coinos is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application">progressive</a> so it can be installed
          on any platform, mobile or desktop, and launched as an app for a
          full-screen experience or accessed as a website within a
          browser.
        </p>

        <p>
        Accounts can be funded with <a href="https://bitcoin.org">bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://blockstream.com/liquid/">liquid</a> or
        <a href="http://lightning.network/">lightning</a> payments. Outgoing payments can be sent using any of the
          above methods as well. Coinos acts as a kind of access
          control layer, giving users the ability to spend and receive from all three 
          networks with a single unified balance with their spending power limited by how much they've deposited or received.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users of our hosted server will enjoy a streamlined experience with one-click account creation
          because they donâ€™t need to worry about server setup, software
          installation, blockchain synchronization, establishing and managing
          payment channels or account configuration of any kind.
        </p>

        <p>
        User accounts, balances and payment history in coinos are stored in a <a href="https://mariadb.org/">relational database</a>.
          Exchange rates are fetched from
          <a href="https://binance.com/">Binance</a> and
          <a href="https://fixer.io/">Fixer</a>.
